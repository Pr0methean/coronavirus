## Folders
- data
    - target: Target sequences (SARS|HKU1|MERS|nCoV)
    - host: Host / off-target sequences

    - parts: Sequences to include in plasmids
    - test: small files for fast tests
    - snapshots: sample test output


## Problem: Covid-19 Outbreak

- We see globally active silent spread of SARS-Cov-2 causing COVID-19 exponentially more lethal than flu. 
- Further increases in virulence / lethality must be anticipated because the virus can mutate many times per day
- At almost 1 million confirmed cases, we have still yet to show an inflection point, so we can expect at least 2 million cases, and potentially many more
- Vaccines require longterm monitoring and thus won't be ready in the near term

## Challenge

- How do you treat Coronavirus safely, effectively, and efficiently? 


## Opportunity

- delete coronavirus genome conserved sequences with CRISPR RNA-guided RNA-knockdown
- deliver with inhalers of adenovirus (non-replicating)
- express therapy only in susceptible cells with ACE2 promoter

## Prepare

- install clustal omega 
- install redis-cli and redis-server 
- run redis
- download sequences of SARS, MERS, HKU1, and as many SARS-nCoV-2 genomes as possible from ncbi virus (.fa or .fasta format)

## Act

- combine the SARS-nCoV-2 files with `cat $(ls -t) > combined.fasta`
- generate a SARS-nCoV-2 consensus using EMBL EMBOSS CONS https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/emboss_cons/ between as many SARS-nCoV-2 sequences as can be found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/
- copy the consensus sequence into a new file
- combine the SARS-nCoV-2 files with `cat $(ls -t) > combined.fasta`
- align the prior outbreak sequences with the new consensus with `clustal -i combined.fasta -o combined.clu -outfmt=clu`
- open the alignment and use CTRL-F and type `************` until you can't find any matches, then back up and copy this conserved substring from the SARS-nCoV-2 sequence into some file (i did this already) ... gradually delete stars to get more conserved substrings
- run `python bio_firewall.py` with python 3.8

## Reflect

- fancy stuff didn't work (adding the whole transcriptome to the whitelist was WAY too slow on my laptop...but it's embarassingly parallelizable problem to divide this text file and make kmers)
- download human transcriptome with this link: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/001/405/GCF_000001405.39_GRCh38.p13/GCF_000001405.39_GRCh38.p13_rna.fna.gz found on page: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=homo+sapiens
- tried a wobble powerset algorithm (see comments at bottom of design_guides.py) but this caused a combinatorial explosion because there are an insane number of possible 30mers. Could use a MAX ENTROPY heuristic for this algo to just choose the nucleotides which accomodate most wobble
- there are probably some gotchas in the gRNA design which haven't been accounted
- since I couldn't whitelist the whole transcriptome, the lung microRNA and long non-coding RNA aren't in the whitelist, which presents an opportunity for off target effects
- likewise, I'm not using Levenshtein distance for whitelist cache hits, only exact matches, and there weren't any. That might be a false negative because guides could tolerate some mispairing, and wobble pairing, but I wanted to produce results and then improve it later

## Troubleshoot

- redis.exceptions.ConnectionError: Error 111 connecting to localhost:6379. Connection refused.
    - check Redis is running
- cassandra.protocol.SyntaxException: <Error from server: code=2000 [Syntax error in CQL query] message="line 1:0 no viable alternative at input 'X'">
    - check if your input X is supported by the datastax cassandra-driver... some admin stuff only works in cqlsh
